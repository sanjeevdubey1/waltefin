        Mumbai 3.0: A New Era for Homebuyers – How Infrastructure Growth is Boosting Home Loan Opportunities
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Mumbai 3.0 is not just a development plan – it's a vision to transform the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) into a global financial and residential hub. With upcoming infrastructure like the Navi Mumbai International Airport, Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), and expanded Metro connectivity, property demand is rapidly growing in areas like Panvel, Ulwe, Dronagiri, Kharghar, Karanjade, and Pushpak Nagar.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What is Mumbai 3.0?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Mumbai 3.0 refers to the planned development of Mumbai’s extended suburbs into a smart, well-connected cityscape. It includes massive investment in transport, housing, digital infrastructure, and green spaces. The goal is to decongest South Mumbai and shift both residential and business interest to Navi Mumbai and nearby zones.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This initiative is expected to reshape the real estate landscape by promoting affordable housing, seamless commute, and improved lifestyle for citizens. Government-backed infrastructure projects ensure long-term growth, making now a perfect time to invest in property.
